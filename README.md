# JavaScript Self-Driving Car Simulator

## Introduction
This project is a self-driving car simulator built entirely in plain JavaScript, without the use of any external libraries. It aims to demonstrate the fundamentals of autonomous vehicle technology, including car mechanics, sensor implementation, collision detection, and neural networks.

## Project Structure
The code for this project is divided into several parts, each focusing on a key aspect of self-driving car technology:

1. **Car Driving Mechanics**: Implementation of basic car movement and control mechanics.
2. **Road Definition**: Creating a virtual environment with defined roads for the car to navigate.
3. **Artificial Sensors**: Simulating sensors that help the car perceive its surroundings.
4. **Collision Detection**: Detecting and responding to collisions with objects or boundaries.
5. **Traffic Simulation**: Introducing other vehicles and simulating traffic scenarios.
6. **Neural Network**: Building a neural network to enable autonomous driving decisions.
7. **Visualizing Neural Networks**: Tools and techniques for visualizing how the neural network operates.
8. **Optimizing Neural Networks**: Enhancing the performance and efficiency of the neural network.
9. **Fine-Tuning**: Adjustments and refinements to improve overall simulation accuracy and performance.
